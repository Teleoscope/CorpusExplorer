Whatever. \n\nSecond, to say, \"i just love you.\" Sweet. \n\nThird, to say he's going to the fencing store. Okay. \n\nBut he grabbed my throat and pretended to choke me. Than he said something about me being bad or something like that. I told him, as he was brushing his beard that he needs to learn to talk to me sweetly. Than he said, you've been a \"dirty, bad vile girl in your life. We all make choices and you made all the wrong ones.\" I said, im not talking to him anymore for the rest of the day. He walked out the bedroom door to turn on sprinkler and came back in and said, \"hi baby, I was only joking.\" I didn't respond so he kept going. \"I'm sorry you can't take a joke.\" I still didn't say anything. \n\nThere is a history here. We have had the same fight for 9 months. He gets drunk and does a full 180 and brings up my past and fully throws it in my face and calls me names and insults me. Im talking stuff that happened over 5 years ago. I maybe could understand him bringing up my past if I did anything to him but I dont. Regardless. He said he would stop doing it. And since our big fight, he makes jokes like that. But let's be real, hes not joking. \n\nHe told me i was overreacting to his joke and went on to say he was just gonna go to a bar the rest of the day because i can't take a joke. \n\nI'm not giving in. Im not talking to him. \n\nAITA?! \n\nFor a moment, he got into my head and I almost felt bad.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Read &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole\"&gt;contacting the mod team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m laying in bed at 10 am because im cold and want to look at videos on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bf has been in and out of the house doing some things here and there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time he comes in, he pops in the bedroom to say something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, he expected me to buy him work pants. Whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, to say, &amp;quot;i just love you.&amp;quot; Sweet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, to say he&amp;#39;s going to the fencing store. Okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he grabbed my throat and pretended to choke me. Than he said something about me being bad or something like that. I told him, as he was brushing his beard that he needs to learn to talk to me sweetly. Than he said, you&amp;#39;ve been a &amp;quot;dirty, bad vile girl in your life. We all make choices and you made all the wrong ones.&amp;quot; I said, im not talking to him anymore for the rest of the day. He walked out the bedroom door to turn on sprinkler and came back in and said, &amp;quot;hi baby, I was only joking.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t respond so he kept going. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry you can&amp;#39;t take a joke.&amp;quot; I still didn&amp;#39;t say anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a history here. We have had the same fight for 9 months. He gets drunk and does a full 180 and brings up my past and fully throws it in my face and calls me names and insults me. Im talking stuff that happened over 5 years ago. I maybe could understand him bringing up my past if I did anything to him but I dont. Regardless. He said he would stop doing it. And since our big fight, he makes jokes like that. But let&amp;#39;s be real, hes not joking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me i was overreacting to his joke and went on to say he was just gonna go to a bar the rest of the day because i can&amp;#39;t take a joke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not giving in. Im not talking to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA?! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a moment, he got into my head and I almost felt bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
