Mine and my moms relationship has always been rocking but ever since moving back to my hometown our relationship was really good. After being home for about 3 months and being quarantined for about a month and a half we decided to have 3 friends over to watch a game. I was putting my son to sleep and my mother was blowing up my phone. I texted and saying that I was putting the baby to sleep and she texted back \u201cif you don\u2019t answer the phone right now I\u2019m going to the house\u201d in a very threatening way. So I FaceTimed and I was whispering to her and she started mocking me and asking was I was doing so I told her we had some friends over. She yelled back don\u2019t make me mad and hung up. So I was like WTF lol and she texted me 30 minutes later asking if I wasn\u2019t gonna call her back. I didn\u2019t because SHE hung up on me for no reason. So I didn\u2019t talk to her and the next day we had a very nice family day. We took my son to the park and had dessert. We got back home around 8 and had a small movie night and so I was putting my son to sleep and it was around 10 and she called AGAIN and I texted back \u201cI\u2019m putting the baby to sleep\u201d and she\u2019s like again?!? And I didn\u2019t text back. I was in the room with my son for about an hour and my husband comes in and tells me there\u2019s someone outside and I went into my living room and there was my mother with my in laws. So turns out my mom had talked my husbands mom about how me and my husband were having problems and calling my husband an alcoholic. My husband drinks occasionally a few beers but nothing crazy. She told my mother in law that we were constantly having parties and that my son shouldn\u2019t be growing up in that environment. Everything she said was a lie because first I don\u2019t even drink and my husband drinks occasionally when watching a game or socially, second we had only had a small get together not a party and that was the only time we had done that. My husband basically kicked them all out. The next day we went to talk to her more calmly and she was just saying that she\u2019s never getting in out business and told us she didn\u2019t feel good and to leave. So I told her to call me when she\u2019s ready to talk. It\u2019s been about a month and she still hasn\u2019t contacted me to apologize or to talk about it and only tells my dad to call and tell me to let them see my son. My sons first birthday was 2 weeks ago and I didn\u2019t invite them. So now reddit, AITA??\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add some more to my post. So my mother has always been this kind of person. This actually hasn't been the first time she has done something like this. She once gathered my husbands parents (we were only dating back then) and went to my apartment in college to \"get us in trouble\" for going on a birthday trip. I was in college, moved out, over 18, and she didn't pay for anything. Also to add to what she said that day was that she didn't like one of our friends because he drinks. She said that my son can't talk to its up to me to protect him and that he has no right being in an environment like that. Well guess what people!? my dad is an ALCOHOLIC who always drank around us and was constantly drunk. So I know what it's like growing up with someone who drinks and always hated it. I would never let my son go through what I've been through and I've talked to my husband about that.My in laws had no clue she was gonna do what she said, they thought she was genuinely concerned. They have apologized and everything is good with them. Also thank you to everyone telling me I'm not the AH.",

Shitty parents are awful all the time, but toxic parents vacillate between having a decent relationship with you and doing stuff like, well, this because otherwise you would be able to cut them out of your life a lot easier. For every low there&amp;#39;s a not-as-bad moment to keep you struggling. If you aren&amp;#39;t yet, I&amp;#39;d suggest seeing a counselor or someone who can help point out from a professional, outside view how toxic she is and then, based solely on this post, I&amp;#39;d cut her out of my life permanently. Take it from someone who has both cut out their toxic mother and had to give his kid one less set of grandparents, it&amp;#39;s okay to mourn the relationship with your mom you and your child didn&amp;#39;t get but it&amp;#39;s not okay to keep subjecting yourself to this toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We have been married for 3 years now and together overall for 8 years. We have a one year old son. Mine and my moms relationship has always been rocking but ever since moving back to my hometown our relationship was really good. After being home for about 3 months and being quarantined for about a month and a half we decided to have 3 friends over to watch a game. I was putting my son to sleep and my mother was blowing up my phone. I texted and saying that I was putting the baby to sleep and she texted back \u201cif you don\u2019t answer the phone right now I\u2019m going to the house\u201d in a very threatening way. So I FaceTimed and I was whispering to her and she started mocking me and asking was I was doing so I told her we had some friends over. She yelled back don\u2019t make me mad and hung up. So I was like WTF lol and she texted me 30 minutes later asking if I wasn\u2019t gonna call her back. I didn\u2019t because SHE hung up on me for no reason. So I didn\u2019t talk to her and the next day we had a very nice family day. We took my son to the park and had dessert. We got back home around 8 and had a small movie night and so I was putting my son to sleep and it was around 10 and she called AGAIN and I texted back \u201cI\u2019m putting the baby to sleep\u201d and she\u2019s like again?!? And I didn\u2019t text back. I was in the room with my son for about an hour and my husband comes in and tells me there\u2019s someone outside and I went into my living room and there was my mother with my in laws. So turns out my mom had talked my husbands mom about how me and my husband were having problems and calling my husband an alcoholic. My husband drinks occasionally a few beers but nothing crazy. She told my mother in law that we were constantly having parties and that my son shouldn\u2019t be growing up in that environment. Everything she said was a lie because first I don\u2019t even drink and my husband drinks occasionally when watching a game or socially, second we had only had a small get together not a party and that was the only time we had done that. My husband basically kicked them all out. The next day we went to talk to her more calmly and she was just saying that she\u2019s never getting in out business and told us she didn\u2019t feel good and to leave. So I told her to call me when she\u2019s ready to talk. It\u2019s been about a month and she still hasn\u2019t contacted me to apologize or to talk about it and only tells my dad to call and tell me to let them see my son. My sons first birthday was 2 weeks ago and I didn\u2019t invite them. So now reddit, AITA??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
