# Teleoscope
 
Teleoscope is a system for searching through large document sets supported by machine learning workflows.

## Tutorial
This tutorial uses data from Reddit's [AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) advice forum. Follow along step-by-step to learn how the Teleoscope system works and to explore this fascinating slice of the internet.

### Search

A Teleoscope workflow starts with a normal text search. You can use spaces for multiple search terms, quotes to search for exact phrases, and a minus sign to exclude words. The searches are case-insensitive and fuzzy, which means that suffixes such as `-ing` are ignored.

Try copying the following search and clicking on a post to read it.

```markdown copy
"friendly" wedding -mother
```

import Demo from "@/components/Demo"
export function MakeDemo(props) {
    return <Demo type={props.type} />
}

<MakeDemo type="Search" />

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    Use up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è or down ‚¨áÔ∏è to navigate the search results and `Enter` to **bookmark**.
</Callout>

### Bookmarks
You can choose documents that you'd like to save to read later by **bookmarking** them. Bookmarks are one of a few ways to **group** documents together. Try bookmarking by clicking on the ‚≠ê or by pressing `Enter` while a document is selected.

import GroupWorkIcon from '@mui/icons-material/GroupWork';
export function GroupIcon() {
    return <GroupWorkIcon />
}





<Callout emoji="üí°">
    You can click the <GroupIcon /> to make a **group** from the existing bookmarks.
</Callout>

### Groups
You can create **groups** of documents. At first, you can use this just to organize your documents. But, as you use the Teleoscope system more, you'll start to use groups as a primary interaction mechanism.

import PanToolIcon from '@mui/icons-material/PanTool';

import ControlCameraIcon from '@mui/icons-material/ControlCamera';

import ReadMoreIcon from '@mui/icons-material/ReadMore';

import HeightIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Height';

import RotateRightIcon from '@mui/icons-material/RotateRight';

import MapIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Map';

import AllOutIcon from '@mui/icons-material/AllOut';

### Workspace
All operations take place on the **Workspace**. You can:
- **Pan** by clicking and dragging on the background <PanToolIcon />
- **Move** by clicking and dragging on a workspace item's titlebar <ControlCameraIcon />
- **Resize** by clicking and dragging on the edge of a workspace item ‚ÜïÔ∏è ‚ÜîÔ∏è
- **Drag and drop** by clicking on a document in the group and dragging it outside of the group <ReadMoreIcon />
- **Zoom in and out** by scrolling the mouse wheel <RotateRightIcon />

There are also reset controls <AllOutIcon /> on the left and a minimap <MapIcon /> on the right if you get lost.

### Teleoscoping
Keyword searches, like above, are great, but they don't get you documents that are **conceptually** similar but have different keywords. With Teleoscope, you search by _example_. The big idea with the Teleoscope that we mix your example documents together to get a much more interesting and relevant results. You connect examples of documents (or groups) to the Teleoscope. 

You can click and drag from **output** area of a document or group to the **input** area of a Teleoscope. Think of mixing together examples like mixing together paints. The Teleoscope produces a list of documents that are closest in concept (and math) to your example documents.
