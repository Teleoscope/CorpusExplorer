resolve the updates from rabbitMQ

- Write stompjs call without connecting it to the call, dummy one, and seeing what return value that we need
- dont delete anything just yet
- swr vs behavioursubject (service vs subscriber)
   - useful for constantly updating data, not super different from subscribe

- swr and rxjs get fetch data from the apis
- apis user clientpromise to populate data from the database
- What I need to don
   - Get data from login (hash it, and secure it) and pass it to mongodb
