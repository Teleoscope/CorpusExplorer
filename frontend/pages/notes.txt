resolve the updates from rabbitMQ

- Write stompjs call without connecting it to the call, dummy one, and seeing what return value that we need
- dont delete anything just yet
- swr vs behavioursubject (service vs subscriber)
   - useful for constantly updating data, not super different from subscribe
