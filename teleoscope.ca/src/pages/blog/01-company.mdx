Hi folks, I'm Paul, the principal architect and designers of Teleoscope. 
Along with a large group of very smart people at [UBC](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/), 
I built Teleoscope to address a research problem that I was having. I wanted to search through
the hundreds of thousands of documents contained in Reddit's [AmITheAsshole](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/)
advice forum in an intuitive, and improvisational way. It turned out to be a non-trivial design problem.

In the last year of my PhD, my supervisor and I decided that it might be interesting to see if 
we could commercialze Teleoscope. At least, we thought, we wanted it to remain available on the
internet for qualitative researchers to use. Along with a few undergraduate researchers, I applied
to the [E@UBC])(https://entrepreneurship.ubc.ca/) program and completed the Venture Founder stream.

From there, we've been slowly building Teleoscope as a company. We're learning all the ins and outs 
of making bank accounts, hiring people, and all the other exciting things about running a startup. 
The idea of this blog is to help capture some of that as we develop the company. Stay tuned.
