# Exploring Camping and Hiking Brand Reddits

If you are a camper or a hiker, you need to get the lowdown on the best gear. Your life may depend on it. 
[Reddit](https://reddit.com) has a lot of great community discussions about camping and hiking brands.
The [r/CampingandHiking](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/) subreddit can answer a lot of questions.
Specific brands like [Arc'teryx](https://www.reddit.com/r/arcteryx/) have subreddits dedicated to their products.

Let's see how we can use Teleoscope to make sense of the thousands of documents that are in those subreddits. 
Using an old data dump, we have 8234 posts about *Arc'teryx* and 32089 posts in the general *r/CampingandHiking* subreddit. 
That's about *40k* posts to go through. Teleoscope can make that a breeze.

## Preparing Data
Teleoscope is designed to work with any text data that is between one sentence and a few paragraphs. 
Right now, the model only works with English and Chinese, but we will be updating to include more languages soon.
For now, data needs to be in a `CSV` file to upload to Teleoscope. You can export from an Excel document. 
Many other apps also work directly with `CSV` documents, so see if there's a `CSV` export option from 
whatever data app you're using.

All that Teleoscope needs at a minium is a `text` and `title` field. All the other metatdata is optional. 

## Uploading Data
Once you have your data prepared, you can upload it to Teleoscope by going to the sidebar, 
clicking on `Data` and then `Open CSV Uploader`.
A window will pop up and allow you to browse for your file from your computer.
Once you have selected your file, a preview of your data will open in the same upload popup.

You can then choose which columms from your `CSV` will be used for the `text` and `title`. 
The uploader will select anything called "text" or "title" by default, but you can choose
any of your columns, no matter what they are named.

Other options for metadata will automatically be selected as well, but they are not required.
For example, the dataset below has a column called `metadata.id` and that has been 
automatically chosen as a `Unique ID` column. It's not required, but can be helpful later
when sorting through your data.
