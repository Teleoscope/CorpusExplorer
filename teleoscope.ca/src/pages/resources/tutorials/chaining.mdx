# Chaining boolean operations

![Intersection-Union](/docs/Intersection-Union.gif)
Boolean operations can be chained indefinitely (although chaining more will update more slowly).
In the above example, we see that the intersection is joined with the `Fishing` group by using union.
All of documents that are in `Fishing` are now joined with the intersection results.

In this example, many operations are chained together to produce a desired outcome.
The first intersection produces only documents that contain both `pizza` and `jalapenos`;
the second intersection produces only documents that contain both `pizza` and `mushrooms`.
The results are joined together, then ranked with a Teleoscope according to a search for `garlic`.

Due to the logic of Boolean operations, you could get the same result by using the same
operations in a different order. In the above, the searches are joined with union, and then the union
is interesected with the `pizza` search.
