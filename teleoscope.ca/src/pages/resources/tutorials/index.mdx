# How-To Guides

The operations that we provide you are simple and can be chained together to achieve more complex results.
Here are some design patterns that you can use if you want to achieve specific outcomes.

- [Ranking](/resources/tutorials/ranking). Use the <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking)
tool to rank, order, or sort your dataset.
- [Chaining](/resources/tutorials/chaining). Use chains of operations to find out which documents appear in
multiple sources, or show up in neither.
- [Filtering](/resources/tutorials/filtering). Use a set operation to join two searches, or to figure out
which terms appear only in one, only in the other, or in both.
- [Focusing](/resources/tutorials/focusing). Use a custom note or text snippet to focus a search on a phrase or
quote rather than a whole document.
- [Weighting](/resources/tutorials/weighting). Use multiple copies of a document to bias Rank results towards
a document you think is more important.
