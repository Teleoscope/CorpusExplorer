# Filtering a Search

![Search-Intersection](/docs/Search-Intersection.gif)
If you want to filter a search by another seach, you can use the intersection operation.
In the above example, the `jalapenos` search is filtered by the `pizza` search, which
produces only documents that contain both `jalapenos` and `pizza`.
