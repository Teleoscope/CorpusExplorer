# <WinIcon type="Rank" /> Ranking, Sorting or Ordering
The <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking) tool allows you to order
a set of documents by similarity to one or more other documents. Let's see how it can be 
used to achieve many different cookbook solutions for exploring data.

![Rank](/docs/rank-group.gif)
The Ran tool ranks documents according to a source document, group, or search. If you want to sort a 
source by similarity to another source, you can connect the one you want to rank to to the top source 
input, and the other to the bottom control input. As you can see in this example, the document that 
the group is being sorted relative to is now at the top of the list.

## Find the most similar documents in order
Connecting a single document to the <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking)
tool will give back a list of the most similar documents to that document in order from most similar
to least similar. 

You can think of this as asking the computer to find you the documents that it thinks has the most
overlap in content and theme based on words and phrases from each document. You might not agree 
with the computer's assessment of similarity, but you're likely to find some similar enough documents.

You might notice common words, phrases, or similar nouns. For example, a document with `wifi` given as 
a control for the <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking) might return documents 
that talk about `wifi` specifically, or technology generally. That's because it's likely that people
use similar phrases to talk about both `wifi` and, say, `netflix`.

## Mix the meanings of documents
Connecting multiple documents to the <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking)
will give you a list of the most similar documents to *all* documents you have connected. You can
think of this as the computer finding the documents that it thinks is most similar to the average
content of the documents. 

## Ranking a specific source
![Rank Search](/docs/rank-search-by-word.png)

Here's a pattern where you can rank a search by word. On the left, you can see that the
`pizza` search is unordered; by adding the Note as a control with the word `garlic`, the `pizza` search
is now ordered by documents that are similar to the word `garlic`.

## How to use this in your project
You can use a <WinIcon type="Rank" /> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking) to discover new documents
that you want to add to a theme. You can also use it to prove to yourself that documents do not exist
within a particular data source, i.e., that you've reached a saturation point.
