## How-To Guides

The operations that we provide you are simple and can be chained together to achieve more complex results.
Here are some design patterns that you can use if you want to achieve specific outcomes.

### Focus on a snippet of text

![Snippet](/docs/note-snippet.gif)
Since notes can have arbitrary text, you can copy and paste a snippet of text
into a note from a document. Connect the note to the control input of a Teleoscope
to only use the snippet of text that you care about.

### Ranking

![Rank](/docs/rank-group.gif)
The Teleoscope tool ranks documents according to a source document. If you want to sort a source
(search, document, or group) by similarity to another source, you can connect the one you want
to rank to to the top source input, and the other to the bottom control input.
As you can see in this example, the document that the group is being sorted relative to is
now at the top of the list.

![Rank Search](/docs/rank-search-by-word.png)

Similarly, here's a pattern where you can rank a search by word. On the left, you can see that the
`pizza` search is unordered; by adding the Note as a control with the word `garlic`, the `pizza` search
is now ordered by documents that are similar to the word `garlic`.

### Filtering a Search

![Search-Intersection](/docs/Search-Intersection.gif)
If you want to filter a search by another seach, you can use the intersection operation.
In the above example, the `jalapenos` search is filtered by the `pizza` search, which
produces only documents that contain both `jalapenos` and `pizza`.

### Chaining boolean operations

![Intersection-Union](/docs/Intersection-Union.gif)
Boolean operations can be chained indefinitely (although chaining more will update more slowly).
In the above example, we see that the intersection is joined with the `Fishing` group by using union.
All of documents that are in `Fishing` are now joined with the intersection results.

![Long chain](/docs/long-chain.png)

In this example, many operations are chained together to produce a desired outcome.
The first intersection produces only documents that contain both `pizza` and `jalapenos`;
the second intersection produces only documents that contain both `pizza` and `mushrooms`.
The results are joined together, then ranked with a Teleoscope according to a search for `garlic`.

![Long chain equivalence](/docs/long-chain-equivalence.png)

Due to the logic of Boolean operations, you could get the same result by using the same
operations in a different order. In the above, the searches are joined with union, and then the union
is interesected with the `pizza` search.

### Unequal Weighting

![Weight](/docs/weight-teleoscope.gif)
If you want to increase the influence of one source on the Teleoscope output, you can connect
multiple copies of that source. Since the source vectors are averaged, having more copies of
something allows you to weight the average.
